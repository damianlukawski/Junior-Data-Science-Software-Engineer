# Titanic - data science project 

## INTRODUCTION
My approach to modeling the probability of surviving a titanic Crash by machine learning.

### Python scripts and other files
The repository contains _data_ folder containing 2 data sets in csv file: 
- _train.csv_ - a dataset for algorithm training
 - _val.csv_ - a dataset used for modeling

The repository contains _src_ folder containing 4 python scripts:
- _preprocess.py_ - cleaning data set, converts train.csv to train_precrocessed.csv and
val.csv to val_preprocessed.csv
- _build_features.py_ - selecting useful data and changing data type.
converts train_preprocessed.csv to train_bf.csv and
val_preprocessed.csv to val_bf.csv
- _train.py_ - training algorithm basing on train_bf.csv file
- _predict.py_ - predicting the result of titanic crash of dataset from val_bf.csv file



###TASKS
#### TASK1 - creating a repository
I forked a repository.



### Completed tasks
##### TASK1 - creating a repository
In the task 1 I created a repository


#### TASK2 - sense of humour
I added a _joke.docx_ file with one of my favourite jokes docs directory.

#### TASK3 - good practices
I corrected the code and tried to clean up the function's descriptions and comments.
Additionally I changed a readme file

#### TASK6 - measures
I created a jupyter notebook _main.ipynb_ file showing the idea how the program should work.


#### TASK 4,5,7,9 
To be honest I can't do it... YET! But I'm sure I'll get there. 
Although I have several years of experience in analysis of scientific data,
Python programming and especially machine learning are rather new topics to me.



### Thank you for the great opportunity
